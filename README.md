# Build-a-Custom-Python-IDE-with-Tkinter
In this session, we’ll go meta as we build our own Python IDE in Python via the Tkinter toolkit. Tkinter is Python’s de-facto standard GUI and is included with installs across most operating systems.  This workshop is one for all the coding ninjas who would like an environment perfectly suited to their needs and stripped of any unnecessary features that come with out-of-the-box IDEs like PyCharm &amp; VSCode—just keeping a basic editor &amp; compiler with a simple interface that can handle files—which can then be customized with unique functionalities of our choosing.

Prerequisites: —Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
—Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
